Interaction proof of concept for presenting and interacting with images (like covers or profile pics).

<br>

I created this project as an exercise. I wanted to implement an interaction like this:
 [http://www.ios.uplabs.com/posts/chapps-animation] (http://www.ios.uplabs.com/posts/chapps-animation), which is also the source of my images (of which I do not own any rights).

Having done the credits, I would like to introduce you to the result:

As mentioned above, I made this prototype as an exercise. Now I want to share the result with you. Please take a look at the code if you are interested in the topic.

The entire magic takes place in the ViewController. I have made as much comments as I could so you should be easily able to understand what is happening.

I would love to know from you!
